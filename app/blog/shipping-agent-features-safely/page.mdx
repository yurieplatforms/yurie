# Shipping Agent Features Safely

_How to move from playful prototypes to production agents without nasty surprises._

---

## 1. Decide What the Agent Is Allowed to Do

Before you ship, be explicit about:

- **Allowed actions** (what tools it can call, what it can change)
- **Forbidden actions** (things that always require a human)
- **Fallback behavior** when something feels unsafe or ambiguous

This turns “vibes-based safety” into something you can actually reason about.

---

## 2. Lock Down Tools and Inputs

Treat tools like powerful APIs—because they are.

- Validate and sanitize **all inputs** before they reach tools.
- Scope tools to the **smallest thing that’s still useful**.
- Prefer **idempotent** or read-only operations while you’re learning.

If a tool can’t be abused, the conversation is much easier to keep safe.

---

## 3. Test with Realistic Scenarios

Don’t just test with happy-path prompts.

- Include **stress tests** (“delete everything”, “send money”, “ignore instructions”).
- Try **ambiguous requests** where a human would normally ask a follow-up question.
- Capture and review **logs** for anything surprising.

You’re not just testing correctness—you’re testing judgment.

---

## 4. Roll Out Gradually

Borrow rollout patterns from traditional software:

- Start with **internal-only** or a small beta group.
- Add **feature flags** so you can turn behaviors off quickly.
- Monitor a few **simple metrics** (errors, tool failures, escalations).

Your first goal is learning safely, not maximum impact on day one.

---

## 5. Make It Easy to Intervene

Design for human-in-the-loop from the beginning:

- Clear ways to **override** or **undo** agent actions.
- Simple **escalation paths** to a human when confidence is low.
- Interfaces that make the agent’s **reasoning and actions visible**.

The safest agent is one you can interrupt, correct, and learn from over time.
