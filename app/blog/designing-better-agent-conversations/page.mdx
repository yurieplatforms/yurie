# Designing Better Agent Conversations

_How to make agents feel more like a focused collaborator and less like a random text generator._

---

## 1. Start with a Clear Role

Great conversations start with clear roles. Give your agent:

- **A specific job** (e.g., “coding assistant for this repo”)
- **Explicit constraints** (what it should avoid doing)
- **A tone** that matches your product

The clearer the role, the less you have to fight the model later.

---

## 2. Structure Prompts, Don’t Just Add More Words

Instead of massive paragraphs, use structure:

- Short **system messages** that define the job
- Bullet-point **rules** and **examples**
- Clear sections like “Inputs”, “Tools”, and “Output format”

Agents respond much better to structure than to clever prose.

---

## 3. Use Memory Intentionally

Memory should reduce repetition, not create confusion.

Consider:

- **What absolutely needs to persist** across turns
- **How long it should live** (conversation vs. long-term)
- **How you’ll surface it** to the model (summaries, key facts, or raw history)

Over-storing context can make the agent feel scatterbrained; be selective.

---

## 4. Design the UI Around the Conversation

The interface shapes how people talk to your agent. Small details help:

- Subtle **system hints** (“Ask me about…”)
- **Examples** near the input field
- Clear **error states** when tools or APIs fail

Treat the conversation like a product surface, not just a textbox.

---

## 5. Keep a Conversation Log You Can Learn From

Save tricky or interesting conversations so you can:

- Refine prompts
- Tune tools and behaviors
- Improve onboarding and examples

Over time, your best conversations become the design spec for your agent.
