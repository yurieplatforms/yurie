# Building Your First AI Agent

_A practical walkthrough for going from a blank repo to a working agent in this starter._

---

## 1. Define the Agent’s Job

Before touching code, write down:

- **What the agent should do**
- **Who it’s for**
- **What “success” looks like**

Keep this as a short one-paragraph brief you can reference while you build.

---

## 2. Wire Up the Basics

At a minimum, your first agent needs:

- A simple **UI surface** (like the chat in this starter)
- A place to **send/receive messages** (an API route)
- Some basic **tooling or business logic** it can call into

Start with the smallest end-to-end path: user sends a message → agent responds with something useful.

---

## 3. Iterate in Tiny Loops

Resist the urge to over-architect. Instead:

1. Ship a tiny behavior.
2. Try it with a real prompt.
3. Adjust prompts, tools, or UI based on what breaks.

Small loops make it much easier to debug weird agent behavior.

---

## 4. Add Guardrails and Feedback

Once the basic flow works, add:

- **Input constraints** (what the agent will / won’t do)
- **Visibility** into what tools it’s calling
- **Simple logging** so you can replay tricky conversations

The goal is not “perfect AI”, it’s a system you can actually understand and improve.

---

## 5. Next Steps

From here you can:

- Plug the agent into more real data and tools.
- Add memory so it can reference earlier context.
- Experiment with different prompting patterns for your use case.

Treat this first agent as scaffolding—you’ll probably throw parts of it away as you learn what actually works.
