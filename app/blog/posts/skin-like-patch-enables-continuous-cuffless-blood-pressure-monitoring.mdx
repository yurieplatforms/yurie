Researchers at Seoul National University, in collaboration with Carnegie Mellon University, have developed a soft, bandage-like electronic patch that continuously monitors blood pressure without an inflatable cuff. Published in *Advanced Functional Materials*, the work targets a critical gap in hypertension care—only 21% of the estimated 1.3 billion people with high blood pressure effectively manage their condition.

## Revolutionary monitoring method

The device estimates blood pressure by tracking the timing between the heart’s electrical activity (electrocardiogram) and the mechanical pulse that arrives at the wrist. Higher blood pressure speeds blood flow and shortens this interval; lower pressure lengthens it. By calculating this time difference beat-to-beat, the system derives both systolic and diastolic values in real time.

The compact, skin-adhesive form factor avoids painful cuff inflation and positioning errors that limit traditional devices to occasional spot checks. In tests, the patch captured rapid changes in blood pressure before and after exercise, showing advantages over conventional cuff-based measurements for continuous daily use.

> “This research challenges the conventional belief that blood pressure measurement is inconvenient and sufficient only once a day,” said Professor Seung Hwan Ko.

## Liquid metal innovation

A key advance is the use of a stretchable, room-temperature liquid metal that matches skin elasticity while conducting electricity efficiently. Because liquid metal’s high surface tension complicates precise circuit patterning, the team applied a laser sintering process to fuse dispersed liquid-metal particles exactly where needed.

Durability testing showed stable performance when stretched up to 700% of the original length and after more than 10,000 stretching cycles. This mechanical resilience supports long-term wear and reliable signal quality during movement.

## Clinical applications and future impact

Continuous, comfortable monitoring could help individuals with hypertension—often called a “silent killer”—track blood pressure anywhere and anytime. The approach also enables exercise-aware insights, supporting personalized coaching and prescriptions based on real-world fluctuations.

The researchers see integration pathways into smartwatches, medical patches, and even clothing-based sensors. Co-first authors Jung Jae Park and Sangwoo Hong are pursuing added wireless communication and AI-based analytics to enhance practical deployment. The work arrives as wearable blood pressure technologies advance, including FDA-cleared watch-like devices and ultrasound-based patches undergoing clinical validation.
