Google's breakthrough AI image editing tool, known as **"Nano Banana,"** has captured global attention by attracting over 10 million new users to the Gemini app and processing more than 200 million images within its first week of public availability. The viral success represents one of the fastest user adoption rates in recent AI history.

Josh Woodward, Google's Vice President of Labs and Gemini, announced the milestone metrics on September 4, posting on X that *"200M+ images edited, 10M+ people are new to @GeminiApp"* since the tool's launch. His post, which included the phrase *"TPUs red hot SRE pagers howling,"* highlighted the intense server demand the feature has generated.

Officially named **Gemini 2.5 Flash Image**, the tool earned its "Nano Banana" nickname during internal testing and has maintained the playful moniker in its public rollout. The feature currently holds the top position on LMArena's image editing leaderboard with a commanding 171-point lead over competitors.

The surge has propelled the Gemini app to number two in the App Store's productivity category and thirteenth on the Play Store's overall free charts. Reports indicate that many users are completely new to Gemini, representing genuine audience growth rather than just increased engagement from existing users.

## Figurine trend goes viral

The "figurine prompt" has emerged as the most popular use case, with users transforming personal photos into realistic collectible-style action figures. The Philippines has become the leading adopter of this trend, generating over 25 million images and ranking as the top user globally.  

Google has actively promoted a prompt that reads:  

> *"Using the nano-banana model, design a 1/7 scale commercialized figure of the illustrated character in a realistic style and setting. Position the figure on a computer desk, mounted on a clear circular acrylic base without any text."*

## Technical advantages drive adoption

The model's success stems from its ability to maintain **character consistency across multiple edits**, addressing a common problem in AI image generation known as the *uncanny valley*. Users can make repeated modifications while preserving recognizable facial features and object characteristics.

Access operates on a tiered system: free Gemini users receive **100 daily edits**, while paid subscribers can access up to **1,000 edits per day**. All outputs include **Google's SynthID watermarking** to identify AI-generated content.

The rapid adoption of Nano Banana demonstrates how user-friendly AI tools can achieve mainstream appeal when they solve real creative challenges while remaining accessible to general audiences.
