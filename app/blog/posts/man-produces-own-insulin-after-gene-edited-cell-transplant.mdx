A 42-year-old man with type 1 diabetes produced his own insulin after receiving gene-edited donor islet cells without any immunosuppressive drugs, according to a study published August 4, 2025, in the *New England Journal of Medicine*. The single-patient, first-in-human trial at Uppsala University Hospital suggests a path to cell therapy that evades both transplant rejection and the underlying autoimmune attack.

## Gene-editing innovation overcomes major barrier

Researchers used Sana Biotechnology’s “hypoimmune” platform to modify donor pancreatic islet cells so they would not be recognized by the recipient’s immune system. The edits combined CRISPR-Cas12b knockouts that reduce immune visibility with overexpression of CD47, a surface protein that signals “don’t eat me” to immune cells. The aim: durable engraftment without lifelong immunosuppression.

> “The patient is making his own insulin for the first time in over 35 years,” said Per-Ola Carlsson of Uppsala University Hospital.

## Early function without immunosuppression

The gene-edited cells were transplanted into the forearm muscle, enabling noninvasive monitoring. Within four weeks, the graft showed stable, meal-responsive insulin secretion, reflected by sustained C-peptide levels and better glucose control. Over 12 weeks, investigators observed no immune response against the edited cells and no serious adverse events.

This safety-focused dose included only a fraction of the cells needed for full insulin replacement, so the participant continued using external insulin. Even so, the result demonstrates survival and function of donor-derived, gene-edited islets without any anti-rejection drugs—something traditional islet transplants cannot achieve.

## Broader implications for diabetes treatment

The proof of concept addresses two historic blockers to curative therapy in type 1 diabetes: allogeneic rejection and recurrent autoimmunity. It also caps a year of rapid advances in the field. In 2024, Chinese researchers reported a 25-year-old woman who achieved insulin independence after autologous, stem cell–derived islet transplantation. In June 2025, Vertex said 10 of 12 participants in its zimislecel (VX-880) study no longer required insulin one year after treatment.

The Swedish case is the first to show donor-derived islets functioning without immunosuppression. Larger studies are planned with therapeutic doses that could aim for full insulin independence. Sana Biotechnology also expects to seek authorization for trials of a next-generation, stem cell–derived islet therapy as early as 2026, pairing immune-evasion edits with scalable manufacturing to address donor shortages.

## What to watch next

Researchers now need to confirm durability, dose-response, and safety across more patients, and to test stem cell–derived products that could be produced at scale. Key open questions include long-term immune escape, graft monitoring outside controlled trials, and how soon such therapies could become practical for broader clinical use.
