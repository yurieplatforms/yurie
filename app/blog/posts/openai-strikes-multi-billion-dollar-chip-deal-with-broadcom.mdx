OpenAI has entered a multi-billion dollar partnership with Broadcom to design and manufacture custom artificial intelligence chips, with production slated for 2026. Announced on September 4, 2025, the move underscores OpenAI’s push to reduce reliance on Nvidia and secure the massive computing power needed to fuel ChatGPT and future models.

The collaboration surfaced when Broadcom CEO Hock Tan disclosed during the company’s earnings call that it had secured over $10 billion in AI infrastructure orders from an undisclosed customer. Sources later confirmed to the *Financial Times* that the client is OpenAI.

## Breaking from Nvidia dependence

The new processors—dubbed **XPUs** rather than traditional GPUs—will be built exclusively for OpenAI’s internal use, mirroring strategies at Google, Amazon, and Meta. Unlike Nvidia’s general-purpose chips, XPUs will be tailored specifically for OpenAI’s workloads, featuring a systolic array architecture and high-bandwidth memory, and manufactured using TSMC’s cutting-edge 3-nanometer process.

## Compute bottlenecks force innovation

CEO Sam Altman has repeatedly called compute the company’s greatest constraint. In August, he outlined plans to double OpenAI’s cluster capacity within five months to keep pace with GPT-5 demand. By year-end, the company expects to operate more than one million GPUs, with long-term ambitions to scale that figure a hundredfold.

CFO Sarah Friar described OpenAI’s compute demand as “insatiable,” citing the need for partnerships to diversify supply and reduce risk. Alongside Microsoft, OpenAI has expanded ties with Oracle and CoreWeave, and now Broadcom.

## Market impact

News of the deal sent Broadcom shares up nearly 6% in after-hours trading following its strong third-quarter results. The company posted record revenue of $15.95 billion, up 22% year-on-year, including $5.2 billion from AI—a 63% jump.

Broadcom projects AI chip revenue will climb to $6.2 billion in the fourth quarter, its eleventh straight quarter of growth. Looking ahead to fiscal 2026, Tan said AI revenue growth should “improve significantly,” driven largely by the OpenAI partnership.

The collaboration strengthens Broadcom’s position in custom AI silicon, where it already counts Google among its clients, and sets it up as a more direct challenger to Nvidia. HSBC analysts forecast Broadcom’s custom chip business could outpace Nvidia’s GPU growth by 2026.
